# Deep Research Integration Summary

## What I've Built

I've successfully integrated OpenAI's Deep Research API into your Lens Navigator platform. This adds powerful, comprehensive research capabilities alongside your existing 4-lens analysis.

## Key Components Added

### 1. Core Integration (`src/lib/openai-deep-research.ts`)
- Direct integration with OpenAI's o3-deep-research model
- Support for web search, vector stores, and code interpreter
- Background mode for long-running tasks (5-20 minutes)
- Polling mechanism for status updates
- Citation extraction from research results

### 2. React Hook (`src/hooks/use-deep-research.ts`)
- Easy-to-use React interface for deep research
- State management for loading, progress, and results
- Vector store management (create, list, upload files)
- Error handling and cancellation support

### 3. UI Component (`src/components/DeepResearchAnalysis.tsx`)
- Full-featured research interface with tabs
- Query customization options
- File upload for private documents
- Vector store management UI
- Real-time progress tracking
- Results display with citations
- Export capabilities

### 4. Backend Support
- Webhook handler for async notifications (`supabase/functions/openai-webhook/`)
- Database schema for storing results (`supabase/migrations/`)
- Proper error handling and logging

### 5. Documentation
- Comprehensive guide (`DEEP_RESEARCH_GUIDE.md`)
- Troubleshooting guide (`DEEP_RESEARCH_TROUBLESHOOTING.md`)
- Example code (`examples/deep-research-example.ts`)
- Setup scripts for Windows and Unix

## How It Works

1. **User Flow**:
   - User enters company name in the 4-lens analysis form
   - Can switch to "Deep Research" tab for comprehensive analysis
   - Configure research parameters (web search, internal docs, etc.)
   - Upload private documents to vector stores
   - Start research and monitor progress
   - View results with inline citations
   - Export to PDF or raw data

2. **Technical Flow**:
   - Uses OpenAI Responses API with background mode
   - Polls for completion every 2 seconds
   - Optional webhook notifications for completion
   - Results stored in local state (and optionally database)

## Key Features

### Web Search
- Searches hundreds of sources automatically
- Finds financial reports, news, analyst reports
- Includes inline citations with URLs

### Vector Stores
- Upload private documents (PDF, DOCX, TXT, CSV)
- Create named collections (e.g., "Q3 2024 Reports")
- Combine with web search or use exclusively
- Maximum 2 vector stores per research

### Background Processing
- Continues running even if connection drops
- Can take 5-20 minutes for comprehensive research
- Progress updates during execution
- Can be cancelled if needed

### Cost Control
- `maxToolCalls` parameter to limit searches (default 100)
- Choice between o3 and o4-mini models
- Can disable web search to reduce costs
- Results can be cached

## Setup Requirements

1. **OpenAI API Key**
   - Must have access to o3-deep-research model
   - Add to `.env`: `VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`

2. **Optional Enhancements**
   - Webhook secret for notifications
   - Supabase for storing results
   - Backend API for production use

## Security Considerations

1. **Development Setup**
   - Uses `dangerouslyAllowBrowser: true` (dev only)
   - API key exposed to browser (not for production)

2. **Production Setup**
   - Move API calls to backend
   - Implement proper authentication
   - Validate webhook signatures
   - Be careful with prompt injection

## Costs

- Deep research is expensive due to multiple tool calls
- Each research can make 50-200+ web searches
- Estimate $5-20 per comprehensive research
- Use o4-mini-deep-research for lower costs

## Next Steps for You

1. **Get API Access**
   - Contact OpenAI sales for o3-deep-research access
   - Add your API key to `.env` file

2. **Test the Integration**
   - Run `npm install` to get the openai package
   - Start with a simple company analysis
   - Try uploading some test documents

3. **Customize for Your Needs**
   - Adjust the investment analysis prompts
   - Set appropriate cost limits
   - Configure webhook notifications

4. **Production Considerations**
   - Move API calls to backend
   - Implement caching for repeated queries
   - Set up proper monitoring

## Benefits Over 4-Lens Analysis

| Feature | 4-Lens (Azure OpenAI) | Deep Research (OpenAI) |
|---------|----------------------|------------------------|
| Speed | 30-60 seconds | 5-20 minutes |
| Sources | Your prompts only | 100s of web sources |
| Depth | Single perspective | Comprehensive analysis |
| Cost | ~$0.10 per lens | $5-20 per research |
| Private Data | Limited | Full vector store support |
| Citations | No | Yes, with URLs |

## Best Practices

1. Use 4-lens for quick decisions, deep research for due diligence
2. Upload relevant documents before starting research
3. Be specific in queries for better results
4. Monitor costs and set appropriate limits
5. Cache results to avoid repeated searches

The integration is complete and ready to use once you have API access!
