## Important Notes

1. In each Zapier Formatter step, make sure to:
   - Set "Transform" to "Text"
   - Set "Input" to "Default Value Only" 
   - Paste the appropriate lens prompt in the "Set Default Value" field
   - Name the output variable something like "prompt_text"

2. In the ChatGPT step:
   - Use "prompt_text" as the User Message

   - For uploaded files, make sure to map {{data.files}} to the Data Files field
   - For company name, map {{data.companyName}} to a Data Company Name field

3. If you encounter timeouts:
   - Try using gpt-4 instead of o3-deep-research for testing
   - Simplify the prompts if necessary
   - Ensure the Temperature field is left empty
