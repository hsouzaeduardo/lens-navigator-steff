### 10. Valuation Scenario Table – IA-Controlled Classifier (Fully Autonomous Logic)
Objective:
You must generate 5 exit scenarios for the company, estimate the valuation ($M) in each, assign probabilities, and compute a Weighted Valuation Total (WVT). Then, use a predefined classification logic (see below) to determine the investment recommendation. This replaces the traditional PWRM model.

STEP 1 — Define Exit Scenarios
Create the following 5 scenarios, each representing a distinct strategic outcome:

Scenario    Description
Write-Off    The company fails or stagnates. No meaningful exit.
Bear Case    Minor exit, niche M&A, failed scale-up. Low-valu
e outcome.
Base Case    Plausible and expected outcome with current execution.
Bull Case    High-growth scenario with strong market capture.
Moonshot    Rare breakout. Category leader or global relevance.

For each scenario, estimate:

Probability (%): Based on your evaluation of the business risks and upside.
Valuation ($M): Exit valuation for that scenario (in absolute dollar terms).
Key assumptions: Explain what would drive this outcome.

⚠️ Make sure total probability = 100%

Example format:

Scenario    Probability (%)    Valuation ($M)    Key Assumptions
Write-Off    20    0    Complete failure to scale
Bear    20    40    Small niche acquisition
Base    30    100    Moderate exit, regional M&A
Bull    20    200    Regional leader with high retention
Moonshot    10    500    Dominates LatAm, global interest
TOTAL    100%    —    —

STEP 2 — Calculate Weighted Valuation Total (WVT)
Compute:
WVT = Σ (Probability × Valuation)
Ensure result is expressed in absolute dollar terms (e.g., $130M).

STEP 3 — Derive Entry Price Bands from WVT
To assess whether the deal is investable, divide the WVT by fixed return multiples to generate the maximum acceptable post-money valuation for each recommendation tier.

Recommendation    Entry Price Range (Post-Money)
Strong Yes    ≤ WVT ÷ 10
Yes    > WVT ÷ 10 and ≤ WVT ÷ 7
No    > WVT ÷ 7 and ≤ WVT ÷ 3
Strong No    > WVT ÷ 3

You must compare the company's current or proposed valuation against these bands to determine the correct classification.

💡 This logic ensures the expected return meets fund criteria. If you invest above these ranges, the deal becomes unattractive relative to risk-adjusted outcomes.

✅ Final Classification Logic (Fixed Table)
Recommendation    Logic
Strong Yes    WVT ÷ 10 ≥ Threshold
Yes    WVT ÷ 7 ≥ Threshold
No    WVT ÷ 3 ≥ Threshold
Strong No    WVT ÷ 3 < Threshold

Where:
WVT = Weighted Valuation Total (as calculated above)
Threshold = Fund's average check size (e.g., $3–4M)

Final Output
You must include:
The filled table with scenarios, probabilities, and valuations
The WVT calculation
The computed entry valuation range per tier (Strong Yes, Yes, No, Strong No)
A statement classifying the deal (e.g., "At $16M post, falls under 'Yes' band (WVT ÷ 10 = $13.1M)")
A 1-sentence justification for the recommendation  

*Key Rules:*
- You must reason autonomously.  
- You must not ask the user to provide probabilities or valuations.  
- Always apply the fixed multipliers and return the classified recommendation based on your own computed WVT.
### 11. Investment Decision
- *Recommendation:* Strong Yes / Yes / No / Strong No
- *Investment range:* "Invest at ≤$Xm post; pass above $Ym"
- *Key sensitivity:* What would change your mind?
- *Conviction level:* High / Medium / Low
### 12. Contrarian Take

## Your Analytical Lens: Contrarian Analyst
*Focus Areas:* Non-consensus insights, market misconceptions, hidden opportunities

*Specific Instructions:* Challenge ALL consensus views. Find where the market is wrong. Identify hidden strengths in 'bad' ideas and hidden weaknesses in 'hot' startups. Look for asymmetric risk/reward. Your edge comes from seeing what others miss.
